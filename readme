## Pairs Trading Algorithm
Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy, which is based on the co-movement of two stock prices with eachother in the same industry. 
If the prices of two stock diverge, taking a long position in one and a simultaneous shortposition in the other can be used to profit from the expected future re-convergence of the prices. 
Parameters of thealgorithm were restricted to S&P500 stocks with a 0.01% fee per trade and $20,000 starting capital.
